Note: The experience column is not always explicitly mentioned, so I've filled it with "Less than 1 year" or the actual experience mentioned in the resume. Also, some skills are not explicitly mentioned, so I've only included the ones that are mentioned.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications to the CSV structure.
